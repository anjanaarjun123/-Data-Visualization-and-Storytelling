Superstore Analysis – Internship Task 2
 
Tool: Power BI Desktop  
Dataset: train.csv (Superstore data from Kaggle)

 What I Did:
- Created five visuals (charts):  
  1. Sales by Category  
  2. Sales by Sub-Category  
  3. Sales Over Time  
  4. Sales by Region  
  5. Sales by Segment
* Added key insights next to each chart to tell the story behind the numbers.
 Key Learnings from the visuals: 
- Technology is our strongest category; Furniture needs more attention.  
- Phones and Chairs dominate sub-category sales; some items need promotions.  
- Holiday season drives spikes—plan around that.  
- Western region leads, so build up Central and South marketing.  
- Consumer brings in most profit, but there’s growth potential in Home Office.
